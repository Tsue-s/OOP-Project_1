I have been given the topic "LEARNING" for the project, and I decided to create a Book Store "Stacks Books" that includes some famous books.

The code shows the titles of books organized by genre.

Also it gives basic info about the book listed, ex.(Author, price),.

I used python and added a simple testing method.

edit: Made the book list show up numbered.
